# Blockchain-Certificates
A very basic Web App to create and view Certificates posted on Ethereum Blockchain.

Storing certificates on blockchain allows them to be easily verfiable. The only thing you need to check is that the
public key of the signing authority of the Transaction matches the public key of the actual organisation.

It stores the Certificate details on the data/input section of the transactions. Currently, it is only tested on TestRPC.
